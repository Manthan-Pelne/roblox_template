To create a website for uploading and downloading Roblox templates with a vast library, focus on a minimalist, user-friendly layout emphasizing organized navigation and vibrant game-oriented color schemes. Here’s a comprehensive plan covering layout, navigation, UI flow, and color palette selection.webflow+3

Upload Template
Library (Biggest collection, advanced filtering/sorting)
Community (Showcase, Discussions, Help Center)
Hero Section (Homepage): Catchy headline (“Biggest Roblox Template Library”), call-to-action (Browse/Upload), vibrant background illustration highlighting Roblox assets.
Browse & Search:
Left-side filters: Type, theme, color, collection, popularity, date added
Grid/list view of templates with thumbnails, hover previews.justinmind
